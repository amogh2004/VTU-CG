COMPUTER GRAPHICS LABORATORY WITH MINI PROJECT

Lab Experiments:
PART A
Design, develop, and implement the following programs using OpenGL API
1. Implement Brenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm for all types of slope.
Refer:Text-1: Chapter 3.5
Refer:Text-2: Chapter 8
2. Create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point.
Refer:Text-1: Chapter 5-4
3. Draw a colour cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation matrices.
Refer:Text-2: Modelling a Coloured Cube
4. Draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to experiment
with perspective viewing.
Refer:Text-2: Topic: Positioning of Camera
5. Clip a lines using Cohen-Sutherland algorithm
Refer:Text-1: Chapter 6.7
Refer:Text-2: Chapter 8
6. To draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define suitably
the position and properties of the light source along with the properties of the
surfaces of the solid object used in the scene.
Refer:Text-2: Topic: Lighting and Shading
7. Design, develop and implement recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to form 3D
sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user.
Refer: Text-2: Topic:sierpinski gasket.
8. Develop a menu driven program to animate a flag using Bezier Curve algorithm
Refer: Text-1: Chapter 8-10
9. Develop a menu driven program to fill the polygon using scan line algorithm
